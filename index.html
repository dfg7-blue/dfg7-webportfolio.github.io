      <p> Welcome to my personal Web Portfolio, which will 
      showcase all of the projects that I have completed 
      over the course of this Fall 2025 semester. Although 
      I had prior experience creating works of art in a 
      digital space such as Clip Studio, I had never before 
      used the several different softwares that I was 
      introduced to in this class. When analyzing how I 
      approached these new digital spaces, it’s obvious 
      that in comparison to the more creative and illustrative 
      style I use in both traditional and digital art, I 
      seem to have approached these works with a more geometric 
      feel in mind. Not only have I learned about these different 
      softwares, but also the history and use behind several 
      of the different digital media we touched on in the 
      curriculum. I am glad to have these new skills, and feel 
      as though my ability to create has been both broadened 
      and strengthened.</p>
